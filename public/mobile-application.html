It is an important document that sets out how you may use the Wooqlaw mobile application (the App) and what you must not do with it. By buying and using the App you agree to these Terms.

        <div class="flex flex-col w-full gap-3 md:gap-7">


<p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">Who we are and what this Agreement does</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">We, Kartoa Technologies Ltd, registered in England and Wales with company number 13631421 and registered address at 2nd Floor, Howard House, St Johns Walk, Bedford, England, MK42 0DJ (Wooqlaw or we), license you to use:</p>

<ul class="list-disc ml-5 font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">
	<li>
	<p>the App and any updates or supplements to it;</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p>the related online or electronic documentation (Documentation); and</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>the service you connect to via the App and the content we provide to you through it (Service),</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">as permitted in these Terms.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">When we refer to you in these Terms, we refer to the user who wishes to use, or has started using, the App, Documentation and/or Services. You must be 18 or over to accept these Terms and buy the App.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">The agreement based on these Terms is between you and us.</p>

<p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">Your privacy</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">Under data protection legislation, we are required to provide you with certain information including who we are, how we process your personal data and for what purposes, and your rights in relation to your personal data and how to exercise them. This information is provided in our Privacy Policy [LINK TO PRIVACY NOTICE] and it is important that you read that information.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">Appstores terms also apply</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">The ways in which you can use the App and Documentation may also be governed by the rules and policies of the appstore from which you download the App. The rules and policies of the appstore will apply instead of the terms of this Agreement where there are differences between the two.</p>

<p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">Operating system requirements</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">When we make the App available to you, we may advise you of certain minimum system requirements for running the App, such as device type, operating system, or minimum amount of memory. We will generally publish these minimum system requirements on our website, through the relevant appstore, or otherwise.</p>

    </p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">In return for your agreeing to comply with these of this Agreement you may:</p>

<ul class="list-disc ml-5 font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">
	<li>
	<p>download and use the App and the Service on any number of devices for your personal purposes only;</p>

<p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">You may not transfer the App to someone else.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">We are giving you personally the right to use the App and the Service as set out in our Terms of Use. You may not otherwise transfer the App or the Service to someone else, whether for money, for anything else or for free. If you sell any device on which the App is installed, you must remove the App from it.</p>

<p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">Changes to these Terms</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">We may need to change these Terms to reflect changes in law or best practice or to deal with updates and/or additional features which we introduce.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">We will give you at least 30 days notice of any change by sending you an email with details of the change or notifying you of a change when you next start the App.</p>

<p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">Update to the App and changes to the Service</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">From time to time, we may automatically update the App and change the Service to improve performance, enhance functionality, reflect changes to the operating system or address security issues. Alternatively, we may ask you to update the App for these reasons.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue using the App and the Services.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">The App will always work with the current or previous version of the operating system (as it may be updated from time to time) and match the description of it provided to you when you bought it.</p>

<p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">We are not responsible for other websites we link to</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">The App or any Service may contain links to other independent websites which are not provided by us. Such independent sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and have not checked and approved their content or their privacy policies (if any).</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">You will need to make your own independent judgement about whether to use any such independent sites, including whether to buy any products or services offered by them.</p>

<p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">Artificial Intelligence</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">The App or our Services, or their parts or features, may implement, rely on, or use certain artificial intelligence solutions, or be based on them. Where this is the case, we will generally notify you in advance. We will always use artificial intelligence in accordance with the applicable laws and industry best practice.</p>

    If we fail to comply with these Terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these Terms or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable.

          The App and the Services are provided for general information and for the purpose of enabling users searching for legal advice to connect to qualified legal professionals.

        Please back-up content and data used with the App.

              We recommend that you back up any content and data used in connection with the App, to protect yourself in case of problems with the App or the Service.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">
    <span class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">
        Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you.
         </span>
            The App and the Services have not been developed to meet your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App and the Services (as described on the Appstore site and in the Documentation) meet your requirements.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">

        We are not responsible for events outside our control.

          If our provision of the Services or support for the App or the Services is delayed by an event outside our control, then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract with us and receive a refund for any Services you have paid for but not received.</p>

<p class="font-medium text-sm md:text-base text-gray-900">We may end your rights to use the App and the Services if you break these Terms.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">We may end your rights to use the App and Services at any time by contacting you if you have broken these Terms in a serious way. If what you have done can be put right, we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">If we end your rights to use the App and Services:</p>

<ul class="list-disc ml-5 font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">
	<li>
	<p>You must stop all activities authorised by these Terms, including your use of the App and any Services.</p>

<p  class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract. You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">The agreement based on these Terms is between you and us. As such, the agreement does not give any third party any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">The agreement based on these Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with its formation or its subject matter, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of England and Wales.</p>

<p class="font-normal text-xs md:text-sm text-gray-600">The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with the agreement, its formation or subject matter.</p>
